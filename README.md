App name: Inspirational Quotes

Approach:
Goal is to have a working chrome extension with basic features
Whiteboarding for structure of HTML, pseudocode before actual coding
Added cool features afterwards


Obstacles:
Getting the API to work
Didnâ€™t realize with first API that we needed a premium key to enable Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers 
Eventually having to choose different API

How does it work? 
Connects to a public API that delivers random inspirational quotes every hour
Also plays inspirational music at a slightly high volume

Stretch features
Premium features give users access to 
Unlimited inspirational quotes
Mutes inspirational music
Quote is read to user by Morgan Freeman
Themes (colors and backgrounds)
